# AmargosaVoleTutorials

These tutorials will guide you through the steps necessary to recreate the data analysis of Krohn et al. (2017, in press at Conservation Genetics). The raw RAD reads for the study are archived in the [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX2515317[accn]), but the input files for the analyses were often too large to store directly here. Instead these tutorials can be used with your own RAD data and will hopefully help simplify the often daunting task of using ANGSD and RAD data with little bioinformatics knowledge to create novel conservation insights.
